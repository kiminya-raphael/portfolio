The goal was to develop a robust algorithm for predicting melanoma recurrence using digitized pathology slides and clinical data. First, I trained a model to identify key relapse prognostic factors - Breslow depth and ulceration - from Whole Slide Images. I then integrated these factors with patient metadata to train the final replapse prediction model.
