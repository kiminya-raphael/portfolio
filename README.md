The goal was to develop a robust algorithm for predicting melanoma recurrence using digitized pathology slides and clinical data. First, I trained a model to identify key relapse prognostic factors - Breslow depth and ulceration - from Whole Slide Images. I then integrated these factors with patient metadata to train the final replapse prediction model.

Developed a remote sensing time series model to classify crops in the Western Cape of South Africa using Sentinel-2 satellite multi-spectral multi-temporal images.

Developed a model to detect lung graft rejection in transbronchial biopsies. The model could serve as a medical decision support tool to diagnose transplant failures thereby improving outcomes for lung transplant recipients.

The goal was to forecast air pollutant levels in urban areas. I extracted and integrated datasets from multiple satellites and forecast repositories and developed a model that can generate daily estimates of surface-level Nitrogen Oxide (NO2) and particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5).

Developed an audio classifier to geo-locate non-speech ambient sound recordings from 9 major cities. The model will improve the ability to determine the origin of audio recordings on Earth.

Developed a model to identify areas at risk of harmful algal blooms in lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and other inland water bodies using Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to measure cyanobacteria concentrations.
The solution is deployed in the [CyFi: Cyanobacteria Finder package](https://cyfi.drivendata.org/)

Developed an object and keypoint detection model to analyze spacesuit movements during spacewalks, enabling accurate posture extraction without the need for motion capture cameras.
