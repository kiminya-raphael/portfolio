The objective was to develop a robust algorithm for predicting melanoma recurrence using digitized pathology slides and clinical data. To enhance predictive accuracy, I first trained a model to identify key prognostic factors—Breslow depth and ulceration—from Whole Slide Images. The model's predictions were then integrated with patient metadata to train the final replapse prediction model.
