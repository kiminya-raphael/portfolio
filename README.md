The goal was to develop a robust algorithm for predicting melanoma recurrence using digitized pathology slides and clinical data. First, I trained a model to identify key relapse prognostic factors - Breslow depth and ulceration - from Whole Slide Images. I then integrated these factors with patient metadata to train the final replapse prediction model.

Developed an object and keypoint detection model to analyze spacesuit movements during spacewalks, enabling accurate posture extraction without the need for motion capture cameras.

Developed a model to detect lung graft rejection in transbronchial biopsies. The model could serve as a medical decision support tool to diagnose transplant failures thereby improving outcomes for lung transplant recipients.
